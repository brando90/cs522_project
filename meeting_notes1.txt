* division by zero, just do it, somehow…shouldn’t be to hard
* Some not very clear to me
    * something about being a number?
* showing the main proof with admitted statements
    * TODO: write a sketch a sketch of proof
        * that would tell us which lemmas we need
* AEvalR is key
    * big step assignment is equal to small step assignment
        * reduced to showing that that arithmetic expressions evaluate to the same thing
    * if we have two while loops, 
        * it will be the same if the blocks and 
        * the beval are the same
